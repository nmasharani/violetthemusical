				This fall, <a href='http://atthefountain.stanford.edu'>At The Fountain Theatricals</a> will bring Stanford audiences a production of the Lucille Lortel and Drama Critics' Circle award-winning musical <i>Violet</i> thanks to the generosity of the ReDesigning Theater and Arts Institute's Spark Grants. This piece, with music by Jeanine Tesori and libretto by Brian Crawley, tells the story of a woman who travels cross-country to seek treatment for a wound inflicted in her childhood. Originally produced in 1997 and set in the 1964 South, <i>Violet</i> is meant to be staged as though the characters are on a bus. For At the Fountain's November production, the characters will actually be in that authentic environment, along with the audience, such that the audience can understand Violet's journey first-hand. Instead of traveling cross-country, the bus will stop at campus locations where certain scenes will be performed off the bus. This unique theatrical experience, a travel musical that travels, is sure to be one that Stanford audiences won't want to miss.
